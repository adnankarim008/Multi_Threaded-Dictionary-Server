The readme describes the files for the COMP90015 Distributed Systems 2021 Semester 1 Project 1.-It contains 5 classes of codes and 2 jar files. The program works by implementing thread per request architecture with TCP socket Dictionary Server. They server program works by asking for a port number and file location for the dictionary file. The dictionary file uses JSON format for easier readability by the program.The dictionary file doesnÕt contain any words but is created upon initiating the program. The uses GSON-2.6.2.jar to build a JSON object.To run the program, follow the instructions below:- By terminal : run the DictionaryServer.jar by > java Ðjar DictionaryServer.jar <port> <dictionary-file> and then run the client by > java Ðjar DictionaryClient.jar <server-address> <server-port> - By IntelliJ : run the server class and then the client class.After the server and clients are running, you can add, remove or query words either through the server or through the client. You can run multiple clients simultaneously.
